# 4-Way Linked List for Phone Numbers

This project implements a 4-way linked list data structure to store phone numbers of users. The list provides functions to add a user, delete a user, display all users, and search for a user's data.

## Usage

To use the 4-way linked list, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/emsherry/4-way-linked-list.git

Then compile and run the main file `main.c` using a C compiler:

gcc main.c -o main
./main

The program will display a menu with options to add a user, delete a user, display all users, and search for a user's data. Follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.

## Functions

### `addUser()`

This function adds a user's phone number to the linked list. The user's name and phone number are taken as input from the user.

### `deleteUser()`

This function deletes a user's phone number from the linked list. The user's name is taken as input from the user.

### `displayAll()`

This function displays all the phone numbers in the linked list.

### `searchUser()`

This function searches for a user's phone number in the linked list. The user's name is taken as input from the user.
